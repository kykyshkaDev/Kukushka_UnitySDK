## Requirements
This SDK requires Unity 2018.4+ and provided only for Android and iOS games.
- Android 5+ supported;
- iOS 7+ supported;

## Get Started
**Automatic installation and Setup steps:**
1) Download [latest version of SDK](https://github.com/kykyshkaDev/Kukushka_UnitySDK/releases) from Releases page or directly from this repository;
2) Add **.unitypackage** file to your project;
3) Open setup wizard using "Kykyshka SDK" => "Setup Wizard" window;
4) Type your **App Key** in the Setup Wizard;
5) Open Example scene and build your Android or iOS application;
6) Enjoy!

**Manual SDK setup in your project:**<br/>
Create your game script and initialize SDK by creating object:
```csharp
Kykyshka sdkInstance = new Kykyshka(new SDKOptions
{
    DebugMode = true,               // Debug Mode â€” when active will always display a demo survey regardless of AppKey, UserID, your geo etc. Useful for testing
    AppKey = "gamedemo",            // Application Key
    UserID = "demouserid"           // User ID
});
```
**Pro tip:** test your integrations with DebugMode = true to immediately see how the game would behave with an active survey

Also you can set custom UserID for your game by **SetUserID** method:
```csharp
sdkInstance.SetUserID(your_game_user_id);
```

**SDK Usage:**<br/>
Now you can call two main methods of Kykyshka SDK to preload and show Survey for user:
```csharp
sdkInstance.HasSurvey();    // To Check and Preload Available Survey for this user
sdkInstance.ShowSurvey();   // To Show Survey for user
```

**SDK Callbacks:**<br/>
Kukushka SDK has a lot of different Callbacks for your game. Use this callbacks to detect Survey Complete or problems with loading.
